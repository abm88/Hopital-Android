# Hopital-Android
An android based basic project developed in Kotlin implementing MVVM design pattern with Clean Architecture using some 3rd party libraries and frameworks with integration of remote CSV file.<br>
# Quick Start:
- Clone project<br>
- Build and Run<br>

# Core Development:
- Kotlin

# External Libraries:
- RxJava <br>
- Retrofit <br>
- Dagger <br>
- Robolectric <br>
- Mockito <br>
- Architecture Components(ViewModel, LiveData, Navigational Component)<br>


# Architecture:<br>
This project uses <b>MVVM</b> design pattern with implementation of <b>Clean Architecture</b> following <b>SOLID principles</b>. This helped for loose coupling and seperation of concern, it will also help seamlessly in unit(UI or Instrumental) testing, scalability and maintainability for future development. 

<br>

# Project Structure:
The <b>Presentation layer</b> lies in the UI package consisting of Fragments and Viewmodels.. The <b>Domain layer</b> is under domain package in hierarchy which includes UseCases, Repository contracts and the Domain Data Models. The <b>Data layer</b> consists of repository implementation and data sources this layer exists in data package.
The associated tests are located in the test folders with the same path

<br>

# General Improvements:
<br>

- Offcourse UI is not well designed this needs significant improvements. <br>
- Code formatting(extra white spaces) and naming conventions should be improved.
